Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water (H₂O). This process primarily occurs in the leaves of plants, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which provides the energy required to convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen (O₂).

The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

This means that six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water, in the presence of sunlight, produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.

Photosynthesis takes place mainly in the chloroplasts, which are specialized cell structures found in plant cells. The process is divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle).

In the light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, sunlight energy is captured and used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct. The energy is stored in the form of ATP and NADPH.

In the light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle), which occur in the stroma of the chloroplast, the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

Photosynthesis is essential not only for plants but also for all life on Earth. It is the foundation of the food chain and is responsible for producing the oxygen we breathe.

### Importance of Photosynthesis:
- Provides food (glucose) for plants and animals.
- Produces oxygen necessary for the survival of aerobic organisms.
- Helps regulate the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
- Forms the basis of energy flow in most ecosystems.

### Fun Fact:
The Amazon Rainforest is often called the “lungs of the Earth” because it produces around 20% of the world’s oxygen through photosynthesis.
